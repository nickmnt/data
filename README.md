<h5 align="center"> A short overview of the contents of this folder </h5>

Basically contains my projects using different frameworks needed for NLP, Reinforcement Learning, Data Science, ...  
All contents related to PyTorch are in the <a href="/pytorch/">pytorch</a> folder.  
<a href="/practical-ds/">Practical-ds</a>  is a big folder related to the applied side of Data Science.  
Subcontents of the PyTorch folder: <a href="/pytorch/implementations/">nlp</a>, <a href="/pytorch/reinforcement/">reinforcement learning</a>  
The folder machine learning contains famous machine learning algorithms.  
The folders "cv", "nlp" (more content in PyTorch folder), "tf", "ml_course" are made using Tensorflow.
