<p>Overall, anything related to PyTorch goes here. NLP implementations are transformer papers implementations (For instance Multi-Head Attention modifications). Reinforcement Learning implementations have the implementations of relevant algorithms (RainbowDQN, Continuous and Discrete SAC, DDPG, TD3, ...)</p>

<h2> :floppy_disk: Project Files Description</h2>

<p>Mostly:</p>
<h4>IPYNB Files</h4>
They are all made using Google Colab. 

<h4>Paper Highlights</h4>
To make it easier for future reference.  
I also copy pictures and important theory sections into the notebooks.

<h2> :clipboard: Execution Instruction</h2>
Pip sometimes has trouble installing the specified version of packages, libraries change over time (not too long), ...  
It shouldn't be too hard to fix this or find an alternative. Other than this, I don't see any difficulty.

<h2> :books: References</h2>
It's either obvious (the original paper), or I have stated them in the notebooks.
